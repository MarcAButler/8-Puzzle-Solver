# 8-Puzzle-Solver
The 8-Puzzle-Solver is an artificially intelligent puzzle solver based on 8-tiled version of the [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle).
The way that this works is that a user may input 1 of 3 algorithms that will be used to solve an arbitrary puzzle of length 9.

## The three algorithms
1. BFS - [Breadth First Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) 
2. BSTFS - [Best First Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search#:~:text=Best%2Dfirst%20search%20is%20a,according%20to%20a%20specified%20rule.)
3. A* - [A Star algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
